 Smart Login System â€“ Project Description
The Smart Login System is a front-end web application designed to manage user registration and authentication using browser-side technologies. The system enables users to securely register and log in without the need for a backend server by leveraging HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap 5), and JavaScript with LocalStorage.

 Key Features:
User Registration
Allows new users to register by entering a username, email, and password. Validation prevents duplicate emails and ensures required fields are filled.

User Login
Authenticates registered users based on saved credentials in localStorage, providing instant client-side login functionality.

Session Persistence
The logged-in username is stored in localStorage and dynamically displayed on a personalized welcome page.

Logout Functionality
Users can log out securely, which clears session data and redirects them back to the login page.

Real-Time Feedback
User-friendly feedback messages (e.g., registration success or email already exists) are displayed directly on the page using styled Bootstrap alerts.
